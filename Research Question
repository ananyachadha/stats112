My intial question was if machine learning can predict the price spread between the day ahead and real time price of electricity. 

This evolved to if Machine learning can classify if the day ahead price is higher or lower than the real time price, 
since I realized to make the trades I don't need to know how much it will be off by, I just need to know if I should buy or sell. 
(since I can't move the markets, the prices today and tomorrow are irrelevant to me). 

And in my combined ML pipeline, we see I can do it! With about a ~80% accuracy and 80% f1 score, and I can't wait to add more data and make it even better!
