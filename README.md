Hi! 
The data I used in the data folders are a free-trial of paid data, from the YesEnergy API. I also used a free trial of meteomatics. 
As a result, this is a private repo, since I don't want to expose paid data. 

STRUCTURE: 
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Exploration
4. Machine Learning
5. Many Nodes Machine Learning (Here, we run the pipeline in a giant for loop, to loop through many nodes. 
This lets us get accuracy scores for many nodes by running just one file.)
The combined file merges collection, cleaning and ML. It omits exploration since we are running a known pipeline.
